# angular-electron-boilerplate

A simple Electron + Angular boilerplate.

:bulb: this boilerplate is based from https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron with less dev dependencies and simpler environment handler.

:construction: e2e tests are not stable

- `npm run build`: make electron run from ng build
- `npm run build:prod`: make electron run from ng build with prod mode
- `npm run electron:watch`: make electron run from ng serve
